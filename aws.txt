AWS TUTORIALS:
<--------IAM---------------->

1)
Users: Users are persons identities used for accessing aws.
Groups: These are used to add multiple users in-order to attach same policies across multiple users.
Roles: These are used to assume identities which get temporary credentials to
the aws, which is used by aws resources,services,etc.
Policies: These specifies the permissible actions a user or a role can
perform. It is written in a JSON format.

2)
Principle of least privilege is the way of giving the minimum access to the
user of role that they needed. It has to be followed that the identity which
has this policies won't be able to do anything apart form what they are
supposed to do. Which prevents from accidential actions.

3)
Identity based policy: These are the policies which we attached to identities
such as Users, Groups, Roles.Which helps to specify the actions they can do
on the resources.
Resource based policy: These are the policies which we attaches to the aws
resources such as s3, SNS, lambda, etc.includes principal which specifies who
can access the resources.
