AWS TUTORIALS:
<--------IAM---------------->

1)Users: Users are persons identities used for accessing aws.
Groups: These are used to add multiple users in-order to attach same policies across multiple users.
Roles: These are used to assume identities which get temporary credentials to
the aws, which is used by aws resources,services,etc.
Policies: These specifies the permissible actions a user or a role can
perform. It is written in a JSON format.

2)Principle of least privilege is the way of giving the minimum access to the
user of role that they needed. It has to be followed that the identity which
has this policies won't be able to do anything apart form what they are
supposed to do. Which prevents from accidential actions.

3)Identity based policy: These are the policies which we attached to identities
such as Users, Groups, Roles.Which helps to specify the actions they can do
on the resources.
Resource based policy: These are the policies which we attaches to the aws
resources such as s3, SNS, lambda, etc.includes principal which specifies who
can access the resources.

4)AWS managed policies:
These are the policies maintained by aws itself.Also updated by AWS. We are
not able to edit the policies.
Customer managed policies:
These are the policies maintained by the aws users. We are fully able to edit
the policies.

5)MFA(Multi Factor Authenticator): Enabling this requires using an addition of
factor to authenticate while we are sign in or assume role.
Using MFA prevents misuse of our credential, even though the credentials got
stole.

6)Service linked roles:
These roles are predefined for certain services with specific trust
relationships. Which makes the role used by that service only.
Standard IAM role:
These roles are created by us, where we can define the trust and permissions.
Which are able to be used by all pricipals we specify.

7)Auditing IAM activity using cloudtrail:
Enable cloudtrail in aws account for all region.
Review cloudtrail event history for a certain history, events,etc.
Store cloudtrail logs in s3 , which helps us to audit logs using athena
We can set cloudwatch alarms for crtitical actions.


<-----------------EC2 & LAMBDA ----------------------->

1)INSTANCE TYPES AND DIFFERENCE:
General Purpose: Balanced compute, memory, networking. Suitable for web servers, small databases.
Compute Optimized: High CPU performance instances, used for compute intensive
tasks like batch operations, high performance applications, etc.
Memory Optimized: High memory to CPU ratio instances used for in memory databases, caching,
analytics, etc.
Storage Optimized: Instances with high sequential I/O and low-latency storage for databases and big data workloads.
Accelerated Computing :Instances with GPUs or special accelerators for ML, AI inference, HPC, graphics processing.

2)Key components of ASG:
Launch template/ Launch configuration: 
VPC subnets:
Desired, minimum , maximum capacity:
Scaling policies:
Health checks:

3)Scaling policies works when the specified capacity reaches. It either
increases the capacity or decreses the capacity as per the specification.
Types of scaling policies:
Target Tracking Scaling:
We specify some target like CPU-50%, so the ASG will maintain the total Usage
of CPU in the instances 50%.
Step Scaling:
Scaling happens in steps based on CloudWatch alarm thresholds.
Example: CPU > 70% → add 2 instances.

Simple Scaling:
One action per CloudWatch alarm.

4)Load Balancers:
Application load balancers:Layer 7, supports HTTPS and HTTP.Best of
microservices,path-host based mapping.
Network load balancer:Layer 4, TCP and UDP are supported. Best for ultra low
latency , real time traffic or high performance usages.
Gateway load balancer: For 3rd-party virtual appliances like firewalls/IDS/IPS 
Classic load balancer: Supports basic L4/L7 routing.Legacy type.

5)Application load balancer uses round robin algorithm to distribute traffics
among TGs. Which send traffic to each TG one by one, also to the healthy TGs
only.

6)A target group is a logical grouping of backend targets (EC2, IPs, Lambda).
ALB routes incoming requests to a specific target group based on your routing
rules (path/host).Each target group has its own health checks, so unhealthy instances are automatically removed from rotation.


7)We can configure host and path based routing in ALB listeners.
we are able to route a host (eg.demo.com) into a certain TG. Just like a path
(/images) into a certain TG.

8)Security Groups are statefull firewall attached to aws resources like EC2,
ALB, ENI, etc. Which handles the incoming anf outgoing of the traffic into
resources from certain ips.

9)NACL is stateless. while Security Groups are statefull. Which means if a
certain ip is able to go into a resource via SG, it can come out as the SG are
statefull. But in NACL, even if the traffic from an ip went into subnet, it
cannot come out with response unless we specifically allow outgoing as well,
as NACL is stateless.

10) In the SG we will open an inbound rule where the type of the port will be
22 (SSH) and insource range we will mention the ip range.

11) AWS will not allow us to delete an SG which is attached to a instance. We
can only delete an SG after detaching it from EC2. If we detaches and delete
the SG, the traffic rules we mentioned in the SG ont be able to communicate
with the ips.

12)EBS VOLUMES:
GP2&GP3: These are the deafult choice of EBS. Uses for boot
volumes,low-latency applications,etc.
io2/io1 (Provisioned IOPS SSD): High IOPS for databases like Oracle/SQL.
st1 (Throughput HDD): Big data, streaming workloads.
sc1 (Cold HDD): Infrequent access, archival.
magnetic: only for infrequently accessed workloads.

13)we can modify the size of the volume via cli or console. volume increases
instantly. we can use the growpart and resize2fs for extending the file
systems.

14)EBS snapshot is the point in time copy of EBS volume. We can store these
snapshots in s3 and vaults, which can be used for recovery and backups.

15)We can enable encrypt option while creating an EBS volume. If the volume is
already created as unencrypted, create a snap with it, and encrypt it while
creating a ebs volume with it.
Benfits of ebs encryption includes data in rest, transit will be encrypted.

16) EBS are block storages, used to attach to one instance at a time. 
EFS are file storage systems, used to attach multiple instances.

17)AWS Lambda lets run code without provisioning servers.You only pay for execution time.
AWS manages scaling, patching, and capacity.

18)Impacting factors:
Large package size
VPC-enabled Lambdas
Runtime type (Java/.NET slower vs Python/Node faster)
Provisioned concurrency not enabled

How to minimize:
Use smaller deployment packages
Prefer Python/Node runtimes (Lighter runtimes)
Enable Provisioned Concurrency
Use snapstart(Java runtimes)
Keep Lambda outside a VPC unless necessary 

19)A Savings Plan provides lower prices for EC2 usage in exchange for a 1–3
year commitment to a consistent hourly spend.

20)Compute savings plan: It is the savings plan which we get buy on certain
computation limit. It can cover instances, lambda computation costs.
EC2 instance saving plan: Its the plan which we buy on certain instance
family. 

21)Savings Plans are more flexible than Reserved Instances.
Reserved Instances are tied to specific instance types, sizes, regions.
Savings Plans apply automatically across workloads.


<----------EKS&ECR--------------------->

1)EKS core components:
->Control Plane:
API server:
etcd:
scheduler:
controller manager:
->Worker Nodes:
application pods:
kublet+kube-proxy
->Node Groups:
->Adds on/Plugins
VPC CNI plugin
kube proxy
CoreDNS

2)Each EKS node is launched inside a VPC subnet.
Pods receive ENIs and IP addresses from the VPC using the VPC CNI plugin.
Security Groups control traffic to nodes and the control plane.
Public subnets are used for internet-facing load balancers.
Private subnets are used for internal workloads.

3)Managed node groups:
This is managed and maintained by AWS, which includes the lifecycle,automatic
upgrades, fully automated provisioning,and health of node is also managed by
AWS.
Self managed node groups:
The users are responsible for the maintenance, upgrade, provisioning (script
or ASG), node health checks, etc.

4)Authentication:
IAM is used to authenticate users and roles via AWS IAM → Kubernetes API mapping.
This mapping is stored in the aws-auth ConfigMap.
Authorization:
After authentication, Kubernetes RBAC determines what the user can do.

IAM = WHO can access
RBAC = WHAT they can do 

5)High Availability:

Control plane is deployed across multiple Availability Zones automatically.
Worker nodes can be placed across multiple AZs.
Managed node groups maintain node health automatically.

Scaling:
Cluster Autoscaler → Scales worker nodes based on pending pods.
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) → Scales pods based on CPU/memory/custom metrics.
Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) → Adjusts pod resource requests.

6)LoadBalancer Service
Ingress + ALB Ingress Controller
NodePort Service

7)VPC CNI(Container Network Interface), which is providing ip to the pods.
Its important cause then only the pods will be able to directly use vpc
netowkring. reduce network hurdles and improve performance.

8)Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) defines permissions for users,groups, and service accounts.
It uses:
Roles → Namespace-level permissions
ClusterRoles → Cluster-wide permissions
RoleBindings / ClusterRoleBindings → Associate roles with users
In EKS, RBAC works together with IAM.
IAM authenticates → RBAC authorizes.

9)AWS VPC CNI (native, modern approach)
Enable network policy support in the VPC CNI add-on
Optionally enable strict mode
Apply standard Kubernetes NetworkPolicy objects
Enforcement happens using eBPF for high performance

Option 2: Third-party CNI like Calico
Deploy Calico
Use it to enforce Kubernetes NetworkPolicy
Useful for advanced or enterprise-grade policy features

10)ECR:
Fully managed, secure, private container registry by AWS.
Stores Docker/OCI images close to EKS/ECS environments.
Integrates with IAM for authentication.
Docker Hub is a general container registry which has certain pull limits while
aws doesnt have. We can access docker hub using username and password, while
ecr is accessible using iam.

11).ECR Private:
Our own private registry.
Access controlled via IAM.
Used for internal corporate images.
Images stored within our AWS account.

ECR Public:
Publicly accessible registry.
No authentication needed to pull images.
Used for distributing open-source or public container images.
