AWS TUTORIALS:
<--------IAM---------------->

1)
Users: Users are persons identities used for accessing aws.
Groups: These are used to add multiple users in-order to attach same policies across multiple users.
Roles: These are used to assume identities which get temporary credentials to
the aws, which is used by aws resources,services,etc.
Policies: These specifies the permissible actions a user or a role can
perform. It is written in a JSON format.

2)
Principle of least privilege is the way of giving the minimum access to the
user of role that they needed. It has to be followed that the identity which
has this policies won't be able to do anything apart form what they are
supposed to do. Which prevents from accidential actions.

3)
Identity based policy: These are the policies which we attached to identities
such as Users, Groups, Roles.Which helps to specify the actions they can do
on the resources.
Resource based policy: These are the policies which we attaches to the aws
resources such as s3, SNS, lambda, etc.includes principal which specifies who
can access the resources.

4)
AWS managed policies:
These are the policies maintained by aws itself.Also updated by AWS. We are
not able to edit the policies.
Customer managed policies:
These are the policies maintained by the aws users. We are fully able to edit
the policies.

5)
MFA(Multi Factor Authenticator): Enabling this requires using an addition of
factor to authenticate while we are sign in or assume role.
Using MFA prevents misuse of our credential, even though the credentials got
stole.

6)
Service linked roles:
These roles are predefined for certain services with specific trust
relationships. Which makes the role used by that service only.
Standard IAM role:
These roles are created by us, where we can define the trust and permissions.
Which are able to be used by all pricipals we specify.

7)
Auditing IAM activity using cloudtrail:
Enable cloudtrail in aws account for all region.
Review cloudtrail event history for a certain history, events,etc.
Store cloudtrail logs in s3 , which helps us to audit logs using athena
We can set cloudwatch alarms for crtitical actions.
